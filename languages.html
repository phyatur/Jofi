        Languages are used to create web pages and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used to
        generate web pages. HTML is a markup language used by website creators to organize text as headings and titles,
        arrange
        visuals on a page, link to other pages on the same website, and more.
    
        It constitutes a trio of key technologies for the World Wide Web along with scripting languages like JavaScript and
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). HTML documents are downloaded from a web server or local storage by web browsers,
        which
        then turn the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML originally featured cues for the document's design and
        semantically explains the structure of a web page.
        Other important tools, like 3D model renders, can be used to produce a range of pictures, from the realistic to
        non-realistic. Images and other objects, like interactive forms, may be embedded within the produced page using HTML
        techniques. By indicating structural semantics for text elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
        quotations,
        and other objects, HTML offers a way to generate structured texts.
    
        HTML elements are the foundation of web pages. Tags, which are written in angle brackets, are used to distinguish
        HTML
        elements. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and
        provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub- elements.
        Browsers use the HTML tags to interpret the page's content but do not actually display them.
        Scripting languages are used to introduce functionalities to the web application; Examples are PHP, JavaScript and
        JQuery.
